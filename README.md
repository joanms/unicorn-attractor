# UnicornAttractor

This is the Full-Stack Frameworks milestone project for Code Institute's full-stack web development course. It is an issue tracker for a fantasy game called UnicornAttractor. Users can report bugs they have experienced 
and request features they want added to the game. They can also upvote bugs and features. Upvoting bugs is free, but users can't upvote a bug they submitted, or upvote the same bug more than once. The only limit on 
upvoting features is the user's budget. Users can upvote any features they like as often as they like, but they need to pay a fee of â‚¬5 per upvote. The site developers will prioritise fixing the bugs with the most 
upvotes and spend at least 50% of their time implementing the highest-paying features.


## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Testing

### Travis Continuous Integration
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joanms/unicorn-attractor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joanms/unicorn-attractor)

The Travis build is failing because of a syntax error in Travis' own env.py file:

File "/home/travis/virtualenv/python3.4.3/lib/python3.4/site-packages/env.py", line 51
    print k
          ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

The build passes when I comment out 'import env' in settings.py.

### Automated Testing
Automated testing is carried out with Django's own testing framwork. To run the tests, run the following command in the CLI:

python3 manage.py test

### Manual testing
I carried out manual testing as follows:

2. Enter the email address of an already registered user and a new username.
3. Ensure that an error message appears, saying that email addresses must be unique.
4. Enter a unique email address and the username of an already registered user.

6. Register several new users by filling in all fields correctly, and ensuring that all data entered is saved in the database.

#### Login

#### Upvoting Bugs
1. Click on the upvote button for a bug not submitted or already upvoted by the logged in user.
2. Ensure that the upvote count increases by one.
3. Click on the upvote button for a bug submitted by the currently logged in user.
4. Ensure that a message displays saying 'You can't upvote a bug that you submitted'.
5. Click on the upvote button for a bug already upvoted by the currently logged in user.
