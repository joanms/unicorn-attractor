        <p>We hope that you enjoy playing UnicornAttractor. We're very proud of 
        our game, but we know that there's always room for improvement, and we're 
        here to give you a chance to make it even better.</p>
        
        <p>The game is free and always will be, and we also fix bugs for free. We 
        are now offering you the chance to pay for new features.</p>
        
        <p>Our issue tracker allows you to report bugs and suggest features, and to 
        upvote bugs and features. Upvoting bugs is free of charge, and we will prioritise 
        the bugs with the most upvotes. However, we ask you to pay a fee of at least â‚¬5 
        per upvote on features. In return, we will spend at least 50% of our time developing 
        the highest-paid features.</p>
        
        <p>To offer you transparency, we have included graphs showing how many bugs or 
        features are tended to on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, as well as the 
        highest-voted bugs and features.</p>
            
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to 
        <a href = "mailto: support@unicornattractor.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>
